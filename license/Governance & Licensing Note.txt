Heavenkey – Governance & Licensing Note
Last updated: October 2025

Concept Date: February 2025
Public Release: October 8, 2025
License Transition: October 8, 2029 → AGPL v3.0

🎯 Why Licensing Matters for Heavenkey
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Heavenkey is not only a protocol for digital inheritance — it also introduces a unique ethical fallback mechanism:  
if heirs fail to claim, funds are redirected to public goods, not lost.

This mechanism creates a new category in Web3: **“trustless succession with social impact.”**  
Because of its delicacy and uniqueness, we must protect it from:

- Opportunistic forks removing the fallback and keeping all funds.  
- Closed-source competitors replicating our work without sharing improvements.  
- Short-term profit projects undermining Heavenkey’s social mission.

🔐 The Licensing Model
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Heavenkey adopts a **progressive open-source model** inspired by the Business Source License (BSL):

**2025–2029 → Heavenkey Source License v1.0 (BSL-inspired)**  
✅ Code is public, auditable, and testable.  
🚫 No commercial use, no production forks.  
🧪 Free for research, audits, and community testing.

**From October 8, 2029 → Automatic Re-license under AGPL v3.0**  
✅ Free and open-source forever.  
✅ Any commercial use requires source disclosure (copyleft).  
🌍 Ensures Heavenkey becomes a true digital public good.

This model mirrors successful precedents like **Uniswap**, protecting early innovation while guaranteeing future openness.

🏛️ Governance Transition – The Guardian Guild DAO
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Licensing is one pillar of the broader Heavenkey governance roadmap.

**V1–V2 (2025–2027)**  
- Protocol under founder control with a non-commercial license.  
- Focus on security, adoption, and ethical fallback integrity.

**V3 (2027+) → Guardian Guild DAO**  
Governance is transferred to a decentralized structure.  
DAO responsibilities include:  
- Managing the list of approved fallback wallets (nonprofits, DAOs, public goods).  
- Deciding upgrades to ConfigFacet and TreasuryFacet.  
- Overseeing bug bounty programs and audits.

**Post-2029**  
- Code fully open under AGPL v3.0.  
- Guardian Guild DAO acts as custodian of the fallback ethic, ensuring no forks undermine its social purpose.

🌍 Why This Matters
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

**For Grant Providers (Ethereum Foundation, Chainlink, etc.)**  
Your support will not vanish into a closed product. Heavenkey is designed to evolve into a public good standard,  
with ethical fallback redistribution guaranteed.

**For Investors & Partners**  
The initial license protects early work and moat. After four years, Heavenkey becomes an open standard —  
but under DAO governance, preserving its integrity and uniqueness.

**For the Community**  
The fallback is not just technical — it is **ethical infrastructure**, transforming dormant value into collective benefit.

📌 Conclusion
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Heavenkey’s governance and licensing are designed to balance:

- Protection of a unique innovation: the **ethical fallback**.  
- Openness to audits, community review, and eventual public ownership.  
- Accountability through the **Guardian Guild DAO**.

By combining a delayed open-source license (BSL → AGPL) with DAO-managed governance,  
Heavenkey ensures that its most delicate innovation — the **ethical fallback** —  
is preserved, protected, and ultimately shared as a **digital public good**.
