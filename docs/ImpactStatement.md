## 1. Reactivating Dormant Capital: A Boost to the Economy

Tens of billions in digital assets sit frozen in inactive wallets.  
That’s not only lost wealth — it’s idle capital removed from productive use.

Heavenkey provides an unlock mechanism. Through **Proof-of-Activity**, it detects when an estate becomes inactive and re-routes assets according to the owner’s intent.  
Assets pass to heirs, who can use, invest, or exchange them.

**Impact:** Heavenkey does more than prevent loss.  
It re-injects liquidity into the ecosystem, supports market activity, stabilizes projects, and creates a virtuous cycle of economic participation.  
Every plan is a potential growth engine.

## 2. The Ethical Fallback: Investing in the Ecosystem’s Future

If heirs do not claim, capital isn’t destroyed — it is purposefully redeployed per the owner’s wishes.  
**FallbackFacet** converts an inactive legacy into active funding for ethical causes.  
This capital becomes lifeblood for:

- Innovative initiatives in education and open-source research  
- Sustainable economies and responsible development models  
- Strengthening Ethereum’s public goods, which in turn enable further economic growth

**Impact:** Heavenkey turns philanthropic intent into an **economic–social catalyst**.  
Capital is not simply donated — it is put to work financing innovation and building the social and economic infrastructure of tomorrow.

## 3. A Standard for a Resilient Digital Economy

Healthy economies are built on trust and predictability.  
Permanent asset loss and governance gaps create systemic fragility for Web3.

By offering an **open, standardized inheritance infrastructure** (Diamond EIP-2535), Heavenkey makes the ecosystem more resilient and reliable.  
This approach attracts long-term investment and strengthens the economic foundations of protocols and DAOs.

**Impact:** Heavenkey is not only a tool for individuals —  
it is **infrastructure that fortifies the digital economy**.  
Ensuring continuity of capital and intent makes Web3 safer and more attractive for investors, builders, and users alike.
